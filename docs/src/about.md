# About the EthStaker Rescue Node

At its {{#title}} core, EthStaker Rescue Node is a community-operated Ethereum node which can be used by node operators as an emergency fallback node during maintenance.

EthStaker Rescue Node was first created to help [Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/) Node Operators survive The Merge in September '22, but quickly proved its lasting utility.
In December 2023, we launched solo validator support.


We have [received a pDAO grant](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/january-2023-gmc-call-for-grant-applications-deadline-is-january-15th/1335/3) to help ensure its ongoing available to the community.

Under the hood, EthStaker Rescue Node is actually five nodes to maximize Beacon Client compatibility, a custom reverse-proxy to combat potential malfeasance by its users, and an API and UI to make it easy to access.
For more information, see the [Tech Specs](./tech-specs/SUMMARY.md).

## Limits
Currently, a single Rocket Pool node is restricted to using EthStaker Rescue Node **four times per year, for 15 days at a time**.
Solo stakers are restricted to using the EthStaker Rescue Node **twice per year, for 10 days at a time**.
Re-requesting access before the window ends will **not** consume additional quota nor will it extend your access, **unless less than 2 days remain**.
Therefore, if you lose your access URL, you can rerequest access to retrieve it, up to 8 or 13 days after it was created.
